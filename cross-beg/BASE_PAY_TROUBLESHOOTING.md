# Base Pay Troubleshooting Guide

## Why Am I Asked to Sign In When Paying?

**Important**: According to Base Pay documentation, sign-in is **completely optional** and **NOT required** for payments. Base Pay works with "any user" and "every Base Account out of the box."

If you're seeing a sign-in prompt, here's why and how to handle it:

### 1. **Optional Enhancement (Not Required)**
- **What it is**: Base Pay may offer to create a Base Account for enhanced features
- **Solution**: You can typically **skip this step** and proceed with your existing wallet
- **Action**: Look for "Skip", "Continue with wallet", or similar options

### 2. **Network Issues**
- **Issue**: Your wallet is not on Base Sepolia testnet
- **Solution**: Switch to Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532) in your wallet
- **How to**: In MetaMask, click the network dropdown and add/select Base Sepolia

### 3. **Insufficient USDC Balance**
- **Issue**: You don't have enough test USDC on Base Sepolia
- **Solution**: Get test USDC from the Circle Faucet
- **Link**: https://faucet.circle.com (select "Base Sepolia")

## What Base Pay Does

- **Immediate Payments**: Works with any connected wallet immediately
- **Gas Sponsorship**: Base Pay covers gas fees for you
- **USDC Payments**: Uses USDC for fast, cheap transfers
- **Optional Sign-in**: Sign-in only adds features, not required for payment

## If You Still See Sign-In Prompts

**Remember**: The sign-in is optional. Here's what to do:

1. **Look for "Skip" or "Continue"** options in the Base Pay popup
2. **Close and retry** - Sometimes the prompt appears due to timing
3. **Ensure sufficient USDC** - Low balance can trigger additional prompts
4. **Check network** - Make sure you're on Base Sepolia

## Common Sign-In Prompt Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Create Base Account for better experience"
- **Action**: Click "Skip" or "Continue with current wallet"
- **Reason**: This is an optional enhancement, not required

### Scenario 2: "Sign in to collect shipping info"
- **Action**: Skip if you don't need to provide additional info
- **Reason**: Only needed if merchant requires user details

### Scenario 3: "Connect to Base ecosystem"
- **Action**: Skip and use your existing wallet connection
- **Reason**: Your wallet is already connected and ready to pay
